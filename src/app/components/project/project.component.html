      <p>A few of Spotipoints best features are:<br><br>
        The user can replay certain parts of songs; this could be the parts you like the most, or a part someone else in the room hates *evil laugh*<br>As an example, make 1:05 - 2:10 play on repeat a configurable amount of times.<br><br>
        You can also stop listening skip parts of songs you dont like and dive in, straight to your more favourable part/s<br>All you have to do is save a favourite part (ie 1:10) to skip to when the song starts, or finishes, infact.<br><br>
        Support will be coming soon for changing the colour of their Philips Hue lights - for example, when the bass drops... the lights change, or flicker, depending on your configuration.
