    <p *ngSwitchCase="projectsService.spotipoint.displayName">A few of Spotipoints best features are:<br><br>
      The user can replay certain parts of songs; this could be the parts you like the most, or a part someone else in
      the room hates *evil laugh*<br>As an example, make 1:05 - 2:10 play on repeat a configurable amount of
      times.<br><br>
      You can also stop listening skip parts of songs you dont like and dive in, straight to your more favourable
      part/s<br>All you have to do is save a favourite part (ie 1:10) to skip to when the song starts, or finishes,
      infact.<br><br>
      Support will be coming soon for changing the colour of their Philips Hue lights - for example, when the bass
      drops... the lights change, or flicker, depending on your configuration.

    <p *ngSwitchCase="projectsService.androidTtrainParse.displayName">Android Timetable Train Parse works in partnership with my thick desktop client named TTrainParse where majority of computation occurs.<br><br>
      Android TTrainParse offers a more convenient illustration for a student that has previously registered with my<br>
      <a routerLink="[/project/ttrainparse">TTrainParse Desktop</a> app to allow them to view, without hopping between considerable amounts of internet reliant applications, their lessons + those lessons' associated trains

    <p *ngSwitchCase="projectsService.NBIdealTrains.displayName">
      Ideal Trains, developed in the NetBeans IDE (NB) is a SOAP web service client that consumes the South Western Railway public endpoints to fetch optimal trains a user could catch in order to depart from station 'A' and arrive at station 'B' at 'C' time with 'D' minutes to spare until time 'E'.<br><br>
      It gives people the ability to develop programs which allow users to schedule their journeys according to walk speeds, disabilities or whether they just like a nice coffee in the morning...<br><br>
      I utilised this ws consumption to display when a user needs to catch a train in order to get to their lesson on time, with sufficient walking time to get from the station to the actual class room.<br><br>
      Full documentation can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/nathan3882/NodeBackend#nodebackend">here</a>

    <p *ngSwitchCase="projectsService.ttrainparse.displayName">
      TTrainParse has a wide ecosystem of projects (except apple...): For example, it has an Android application, a
      Desktop Application along with an Angular application (soon)<br><br>
      It has it's own <a [href]='this.projectsService.NBIdealTrains.githubLink'>SOAP webservice consumption
      library</a><br><br>
      Optical Character Recognition (OCR) recruitment.<br><br>
      User configurablity, set a 'home' station in order to support staying in different places etc, set how long it
      takes you to get from the station to the college (disabilities etc)

    <p *ngSwitchCase="projectsService.bigBookRevision.displayName">
      This project solves an issue of having to write chronological & in order notes on very large text books.<br><br>
      When studying for A Levels, I had Business book that was 300+ pages long + I had to write notes on all of it... so I wrote this program<br><br>
      BigBookRevision makes separate documents in segmented intervals + supports future modification of these documents  + their names<br><br>
      For example, a 737 page book that you want to write notes on. Each new file generated could consist of X pages, but in this case I shall say 50 (can be different)<br>
      15 new files will be generated 0-50, 51-100, 101-150, 151-200..... 651-700, 701-737.<br><Br>
      The user will of course have the ability to amend the upper bound of a file (ie 0-50) to "0-125", "51-100" will change to 126-127" and "101-150" will change to 128-129" etcetera. So the user doesn't have to go in and change potentially 15 different file names

    <p *ngSwitchCase="projectsService.howFast.displayName">
      With this project, you can also measure your average speed between two points, by pressing start tracking, and then stop tracking when you're down the road etc.<br><br>
      The notifications are configurable - for example, when you reach 15 miles an hour, a notification will pop up - "You've surpassed 15mph".<br><br>
      This is all configurable and you can choose to have your speed unit in MPH, KMPH, knots etcetera, it's up to the user.

    <p *ngSwitchCase="projectsService.freelance.displayName">
      All of my freelance projects are currently hidden from view. This is to protect the intellectual property owned by the client I performed the work for.<br><br>
      A considerable amount of clients also require me to sign Non Disclosure Agreements to assure there was no publication of the ideas I was writing etcetera.<br><br>
      This, sadly, leaves no freelance projects being eligible for public display on my website or GitHub; however, they could be available to see the code in person.
